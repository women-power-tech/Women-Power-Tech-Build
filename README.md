# About Women Power Tech

In late 2017 one of our Directors requested the Tempe, AZ lab organize & host an event highlighting women in the technology industry.  The goal was to encourage women, whether they were just beginning to consider the possibility of entering the tech field, were at the beginning of their careers, or have been in the industry for many years.  We wanted to recognize them as vital contributors in the field of technology.  Getting women excited about the changes being made and the impact that change plays in our future was another key objective.  That’s why we decided this message couldn’t just be delivered to the Phoenix area.  The message is important enough that it needs to be spread across the country!  In 2018 we have taken Women.Power.Technology. to Dallas, TX and now, Charlotte, NC. In 2019 we will also be adding Chicago, IL to the tour!

For Allstate, diversity is key to being an industry leader.  Innovation & and an agile mindset make Allstate Technology & Strategic Ventures (ATSV) a great place to work.  The motto of Women.Power.Technology. is Power on the Possibilities! The possibility of a technology career, the possibility of encouraging others on their path, the possibility of being a leader in your own tech journey, the possibility of being an advocate for women in technology… the possibilities are truly endless.
We hope to see you at one of our upcoming events where you too can Power on the Possibilities!
##What people are saying...<

Allstate showed up as a cutting-edge, diverse workplace, brimming with opportunities to power a career forward. - Kathy Rubash

Kim Bannerman from Google was inspiring in that she was not ‘born’ into technology. To hear her story about being 30, a single mom, having no tech experience and fast forwarding to today with her now leading a team at Google is AMAZING! – Stacy Ray-Duty

We clearly communicated a message to the audience that Allstate is not just an insurance company, we are also a tech company and we are investing heavily in building new technology and retaining our talent. - Abhishek Jaiswal

Kathy’s message about 60 percent of working being done in an agile fashion resonated with me because it illustrates Allstate’s commitment to the customer and meeting customer needs both quickly and with quality.
